# BirthRateComparison
This project examines the relationship between socioeconomic development and teenage pregnancy rates by comparing countries across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.

Specifically, it explores how indicators related to health, education, and income — as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) — are associated with variations in adolescent birth rates across different regional contexts.

All analyses were conducted using R.

The datasets used in this study are fully referenced within the code, with original data sources credited in the corresponding comments.

Plot 1. Percentage of births in 2022 by regions: Latin America, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. W. Europe (UK, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Norway and Sweden) has the lowest percentage of births of teenage women in 2022, with E. Europe (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Slovakia and Serbia), with a slightly higher percentage and holding a middle position in the plot, with Bulgaria being the highest value of E. Europe (elongated right tail of red violin). The highest percentage is taken by the region of LATAM (of Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Panama and Ecuador), with Chile holding the smallest value (elongated left tail of green violin).

Plot 2. Slope Index of Inequality (SII) = 4.08 captures the increase in the percentage of live births exponentially by a factor of approximately 59.16, from the most developed country to the least for the year 2022.
