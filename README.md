# BirthRateComparison
This project analyses the relationship between health, education, and income deprivation and teenage pregnancy rates by comparing countries in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.

The objective is to explore how different socioeconomic contexts are associated with variations in adolescent birth rates across regions.

All analyses were conducted using RStudio.

Each dataset used in this project is clearly referenced in the code, with original data sources credited in the corresponding comments.
