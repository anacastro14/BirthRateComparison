# BirthRateComparison
This project examines the relationship between socioeconomic development and teenage pregnancy rates by comparing countries across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.

Specifically, it explores how indicators related to health, education, and income — as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) — are associated with variations in adolescent birth rates across different regional contexts.

All analyses were conducted using R.

The datasets used in this study are fully referenced within the code, with original data sources credited in the corresponding comments.
